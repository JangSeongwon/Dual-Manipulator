Computer - Xenomai => LAN communication
computer to xenomai code : ssh nuc@ IP

        <Computer>
1. gedit ~/.bashrc
    Since we want to use ROS Master from xenomai, we modify ROS_MASTER_URI into ' =http://192.168.0.18:11311 ' IP address of xenomai
    For ROS_IP, use IP address from LAN PORT connected with xenomai

          <NUC>
1. roscore 
2. From ethercat_test dualarm_ecat_ctrl_j.cpp : we need to modify #define NUMOWHEEL_DRIVE (#number)
   + Use cm not as root 
3. sudo -s : before running (3) 
4. Home Position code : rosrun ethercat_test mani1_ecat_homing_j
5. Moving real manipulator joints (Getting node using ethercat) : rosrun ethercat_test dualarm_ecat_ctrl_j 
    + Inside this code, we can select from two subscriber : one from manipulator controller(computer) and one from NUC (arm1,2)arm
    + We can check rostopic by runing rviz
+Made control codes : inside ethercast_test package
